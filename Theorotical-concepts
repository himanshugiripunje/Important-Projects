##  *Microsoft Active Directory?*

- It is an identity and access management solution that allows you to define who can do what in your network.
- it helps you manage credentials of multiple computers and users in same network/domain.
- enables you to connect with linux and windows in same network.

- With a single login, you can access different services and resources without logging into each one.
- with help of that you can access different services at single domain.
 
 ##*what is iam profile ?*
 - can contain only one role
 - one role is for one instance only
 
 
 ##*Features of EBS: *
 - It is availability zone specific, due to it has high performance.
 - you can change its volume type (gp2 to io2) without facing downtime.
 - you can expand your ssd volume.
 
 
#*what is CPU*
---- carries out the instruction from computer program. based upon the instruction it performs logical and arith. operations

###what is RAM?
- Ram is temporary memory bank where your computer stores data it needs to retrieve quickly.
- computer can access your RAM much faster than your disk data. that's why your ram is important.
- 


#why we Use SSD as Bootable volume?/why not HDD?
- SSD uses integrated circuit assemblies instead of moving mechanical parts,
- It can run more quickly, enjoy shorter access time and have lower power consumption than HDD.


##why time of booting is very faster in AMI than booting time of our Computers. 
- Ami Consist preconfigured kernal id and other ram id 
- it is a copy of original AMI.
- that why it is very fast.


##Difference between Hot storage vs Cold storage?
- 

##Difference between Region specific and availability zone Specific?
- Region sp service= you can share your resources within REGION And can access by multiple AZI.
- Availability Zone Service = you cannot share your resources with other AZ.
